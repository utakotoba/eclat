### Éclat

Éclat is an immersive, muted color theme meticulously crafted for focused coding. By pairing a modern, clean palette with a background deeper than typical "eye-care" themes, Éclat minimizes visual fatigue while maintaining exceptional clarity and a seamless aesthetic across editors and terminals.

### Status

Currently, we have two reference implementations — a [Visual Studio Code Theme](https://github.com/utakotoba/vscode-theme-eclat) and a [Zed Theme](https://github.com/utakotoba/eclat-zed) — which showcase the initial aesthetic of the palette. While these themes perform well in most scenarios, their colors were primarily hand-picked based on visual intuition rather than precise calculation. As a result, they may not yet provide optimal performance or consistent accessibility across all environments.

I am experimenting with a non-traditional method for generating color palette. I have established multiple sets of constraint equations and evaluated them in CAM16. Using gradient descent within the constraints, I am seeking optimal solutions based on several rough sensory input parameters.
